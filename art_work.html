<p> Child Abuse Hackathon:
  This was a hackathon where many people of different career backgrounds come together and solve a general problem using the
  technology we have now. The topic of this hackathon was how we can help children deal with child abuse. My main idea was to
  make a simluation based on the situation the child has gone through. But, when we could not find a programmer for the group
  the group decided on a tablet that a child use while they are waiting for a first responder to arrive on the scene. The final
  idea was to have a child friendly tablet that the child can play with and record information on the child's mood and their
  mental state based on questions or the pulse of the child.
